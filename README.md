# hello-world
my first repository

My name is Ankit. I am purusing post graduate diploma in data science from manipal university. So far the journey has been great, I learned a lot of new stuff about coding and analysis. It's now time to explore some trending stuff in this domain. 
Now I am creating my first repository in github. Excited!!!!
